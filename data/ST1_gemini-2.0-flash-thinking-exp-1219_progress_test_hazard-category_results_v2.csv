    FOOD ALLERGIES Consumers who have a food allergy or severe food sensitivity should always

    Symptoms may include throat swelling,

2004,3,19,na,Product withdrawal of Dasani bottled still water,"Product withdrawal of Dasani bottled still water Friday 19 March 2004 Category D: For information only Ref: 12/2004 Heads of Environmental Health Services and Directors of Trading Standards will wish to be aware of a product withdrawal by The Coca-Cola Company of their Dasani brand bottled still water. The product has been found to contain raised levels of bromate, which exceed the permitted quantity stated in the Natural Mineral Water, Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water Regulations 1999 as amended. The product has been on sale throughout the UK in retail outlets and from vending machines. The product recalled is: All Dasani bottled still water No other Coca Cola products are known to be affected Local authorities may wish to refer to the Food Standard Agency's web statement and Q&A regarding Dasani water attached below. The Coca-Cola Company has issued a press statement (see attached). In addition a consumer care line has been set up by the company, the number for which is: 0800 227 711. Product withdrawal statement issued by the Coca-Cola Company Voluntary withdrawal of Dasani in UK 11.45 am Friday 19 March To ensure that only products of the highest quality are provided to our consumers, Coca-Cola is voluntarily withdrawing all Dasani products currently in the marketplace in the UK. The withdrawal began on Friday, 19 March 2004, and will be 80-85 per cent completed within 24 hours. Calcium is a legal requirement in all bottled water products in the UK, including Dasani. To deliver the required calcium, we add back calcium chloride into the product. Through detailed analysis, we discovered that our product did not meet our quality standards. Because of the high level of bromide contained in the calcium chloride, a derivate of bromide, bromate, was formed at a level that exceeded UK legal standards. This occurred during the ozonisation process we employ in manufacturing. Immediately after we identified this issue, we consulted with the Food Standards Agency. The FSA has confirmed that there is no immediate health or safety issue. The withdrawal is a precautionary measure. If consumers have concerns or wish to return product purchased they should contact the free phone consumer care line 0800 227 711. The care line number appears on all Dasani packs. We are working closely with all our stockists to remove the product from the marketplace. This withdrawal only affects Dasani in the UK market. Our consumers rightly expect that our products meet only the highest possible standards for quality as well as all UK regulations.

Consumers who have a food allergy, or severe food sensitivity, should always read ingredient labels. In restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing ingredient is in the food.
                                              
A food allergy occurs when the immune system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed.
                                              
Symptoms may include throat swelling, breathing trouble or a rash.
                                              
Strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction.
                                              
Several foods account for 90% of allergic reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, and wheat.
                                              
Persons who have a severe, life-threatening food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine.
                                              
                                          
                                                                               
                                                                            
                                    
 The products were produced on various dates in September 2005, December 2005, January 2006 and February 2006 and sold to retail establishments nationwide.
                                  
 National Custom Packaging, Inc., a Castroville, Calif., establishment (Est. 21340) serves as the co-packer for Unilever United States, Inc.s Bertolli brand products and packaged these products subject to recall.
                                  
 The problem was discovered by a supplier who then notified the company. FSIS has had no reports of illness due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an allergic reaction should contact a physician.
                                  
 Consumers with questions about the recall should call the Bertolli toll-free recall hotline at (866) 837-7592. Media with questions about the recall should call Unilever United States, Inc., Associate Manager of Communications Sabrina Glavin at (877) 995-4483.","On 2006-03-07, occurred in us.

Strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction.
                                              
Several foods account for 90% of allergic reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, and wheat.
                                              
Persons who have a severe, life-threatening food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine.
                                              
                                          
                                                                               
                                                                            
                                    
 The products were produced on various dates in September 2005, December 2005, January 2006 and February 2006 and sold to retail establishments nationwide.

2009,5,17,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america announces voluntary nationwide recall of peanut butter,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (January 13, 2009) – Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), a peanut processing company and maker of peanut butter for bulk distribution to institutions, food service industries, and private label food companies, today announced a voluntary recall of peanut butter produced in its Blakely, Georgia processing facility because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
All product affected was produced on or after July 1, 2008, specific to the lot numbers and descriptions listed below.
The peanut butter being recalled is sold by PCA in bulk packaging to distributors for institutional and food service industry use. It is also sold under the brand name Parnell’s Pride to those same industries. Additionally, it is sold by the King Nut Company under the label King Nut. PCA customers who received the recalled product are being notified by telephone and in writing.
None of the peanut butter being recalled is sold directly to consumers through retail stores.
“We deeply regret that this has happened,” said Stewart Parnell, owner and president of PCA. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily withdrawing this product and contacting our customers. We are taking these actions with the safety of our consumers as our first priority.”
PCA initiated this recall after an open container of King Nut brand peanut butter in a long-term care facility in Minnesota was found to contain a strain of salmonella. King Nut brand peanut butter is produced by PCA.
According to the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Minnesota laboratory analyses on the contamination in the already-opened container of peanut butter have the same genetic fingerprint as the cases in the national outbreak that has sickened almost 400 people in 42 states.
The voluntary recall of 21 lots of its peanut butter, in containers ranging from five to 50 pounds, is being taken immediately. PCA is notifying its institutional customers and has set up a toll-free hotline number 1-877-564-7080 to answer questions.
PCA is continuing to work closely and cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as state officials as part of this ongoing investigation.
According to a CDC update issued on their website today (January 13, 2009), preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public health officials has suggested peanut butter as a likely source. The CDC and other public health officials are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of infection with the outbreak strains, and to gather and analyze data or exposures that may be associated with illness. To date, no association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores.
Customers are asked to take all peanut butter manufactured with the lot numbers listed below out of distribution immediately. Customers can call the following toll-free 24-hour number 1-877-564-7080 for further instructions on what to do with the product or visit the company website at www.peanutcorp.com for additional information.
Eating food contaminated with Salmonella can result in abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and fever. Most people infected with Salmonella develop the symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses. For more information on the salmonella bacteria, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.

It is also sold under the brand name Parnell’s Pride to those same industries. Additionally, it is sold by the King Nut Company under the label King Nut. PCA customers who received the recalled product are being notified by telephone and in writing.
None of the peanut butter being recalled is sold directly to consumers through retail stores.
“We deeply regret that this has happened,” said Stewart Parnell, owner and president of PCA. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily withdrawing this product and contacting our customers. We are taking these actions with the safety of our consumers as our first priority.”
PCA initiated this recall after an open container of King Nut brand peanut butter in a long-term care facility in Minnesota was found to contain a strain of salmonella. King Nut brand peanut butter is produced by PCA.
According to the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Minnesota laboratory analyses on the contamination in the already-opened container of peanut butter have the same genetic fingerprint as the cases in the national outbreak that has sickened almost 400 people in 42 states.
The voluntary recall of 21 lots of its peanut butter, in containers ranging from five to 50 pounds, is being taken immediately. PCA is notifying its institutional customers and has set up a toll-free hotline number 1-877-564-7080 to answer questions.
PCA is continuing to work closely and cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as state officials as part of this ongoing investigation.
According to a CDC update issued on their website today (January 13, 2009), preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public health officials has suggested peanut butter as a likely source. The CDC and other public health officials are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of infection with the outbreak strains, and to gather and analyze data or exposures that may be associated with illness. To date, no association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores.
Customers are asked to take all peanut butter manufactured with the lot numbers listed below out of distribution immediately. Customers can call the following toll-free 24-hour number 1-877-564-7080 for further instructions on what to do with the product or visit the company website at www.peanutcorp.com for additional information.
Eating food contaminated with Salmonella can result in abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and fever. Most people infected with Salmonella develop the symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses. For more information on the salmonella bacteria, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.

2010,1,15,us,New York Firm Recalls Beef Carcass That Contains Prohibited Materials,"WASHINGTON, January 15, 2010 - Jerry Hayes Meats Inc., a Newark Valley, N.Y., establishment is recalling approximately 490 pounds of a beef carcass that may not have had the spinal column removed, which is not compliant with regulations that require the removal of spinal cord and vertebral column from cattle over 30 months of age, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 Spinal cord and vertebral column are considered a specified risk material (SRM) and must be removed from cattle over 30 months of age in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that are known to contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore, FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent.
                                  
 The products subject to recall include: 
                                   1- ""BEEF CARCASS,"" which bears the establishment number ""EST. 04488 M"" inside the USDA mark of inspection.
                                  
 The product was packed on January 7, 2010, and sold to a single customer in New York.
                                  
 The problem was discovered through routine FSIS inspection activities. FSIS has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product.
                                  
 FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

                                  E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 FSIS became aware of the problem on July 15 when the agency was notified by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) of a small  
                                  E. coli O157:H7 cluster of illnesses with a rare strain as determined by PFGE subtyping. A total of six patients with illness onset dates between April 8 and June 18, 2010 were reported at that time. After further review, CDPH added another patient from February to the case count, bringing the count to seven. FSIS is continuing to work with the CDPH and the company on the investigation. Anyone with signs or symptoms of foodborne illness should contact a health care provider.

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.
                                              
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
Consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160° F.
                                              
 Color is NOT a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as

The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.
                                              
Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

 The products subject to recall bear the establishment number ""EST. 8268"" inside the USDA mark of inspection as well as a production code of 27509 through 01210. These products were produced on various dates between Oct. 2, 2009 and Jan. 12, 2010 and were distributed to retail outlets and institutional foodservice providers in California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Arizona and internationally, and to a firm in California for further processing. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on FSIS' website at  
                                  http://www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Recalls/

 FSIS and the establishment are concerned that some product may still be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS strongly encourages consumers to check their freezers and immediately discard any product that is the subject of this recall.
                                  E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
                                  
 FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of a recall and that steps are taken to make certain that a suspect product is no longer available to consumers.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.
                                  
 Media and consumer questions regarding the recall should be directed to the company's spokespeople, Vanessa Smith at (916) 492-5314 or Brooke Burgess at (916) 492-5321.

 WASHINGTON, August 6, 2010 - Valley Meat Company, a Modesto, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately one million pounds of frozen ground beef patties and bulk ground beef products that may be contaminated with  
                                  E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 FSIS became aware of the problem on July 15 when the agency was notified by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) of a small  
                                  E. coli O157:H7 cluster of illnesses with a rare strain as determined by PFGE subtyping. A total of six patients with illness onset dates between April 8 and June 18, 2010 were reported at that time. After further review, CDPH added another patient from February to the case count, bringing the count to seven. FSIS is continuing to work with the CDPH and the company on the investigation. Anyone with signs or symptoms of foodborne illness should contact a health care provider.
                                                                          
                                                                            
                                       
                                         
                                                                                               PREPARING GROUND BEEF FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.
                                              
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
Consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160° F.
                                              
 Color is NOT a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as  
                                              E. coli O157:H7.
                                              
The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.
                                              
Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

 The products subject to recall bear the establishment number ""EST. 8268"" inside the USDA mark of inspection as well as a production code of 27509 through 01210. These products were produced on various dates between Oct. 2, 2009 and Jan. 12, 2010 and were distributed to retail outlets and institutional foodservice providers in California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Arizona and internationally, and to a firm in California for further processing. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on FSIS' website at

 FSIS and the establishment are concerned that some product may still be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS strongly encourages consumers to check their freezers and immediately discard any product that is the subject of this recall.
                                  E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
                                  
 FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of a recall and that steps are taken to make certain that a suspect product is no longer available to consumers.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.
                                  
 Media and consumer questions regarding the recall should be directed to the company's spokespeople, Vanessa Smith at (916) 492-5314 or Brooke Burgess at (916) 492-5321.

2010,8,19,us,2010 - NuCal Foods Conducts Recall of Shell Eggs Supplied from Wright County Egg Because of Possible Health Risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Ripon, California - August 17, 2010 - The following statement was released by officials of NuCal Foods of Ripon, California regarding the voluntary recall of shell eggs supplied from Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa.
NuCal Foods is voluntarily recalling specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg and packaged by NuCal Foods because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis or arthritis.
Eggs affected by this recall were distributed to food wholesalers and retailers in California and Nevada. NuCal Foods received these eggs from Wright County Egg which were then packaged into 5-dozen overwrapped retail units. In addition to those products listed in the original Wright County Egg media statement dated August 13, 2010, the following products are being recalled:
 
Dates and codes can be found printed on the overwrap film. The plant number begins with the letter P and then the number. The Julian date follows the plant number, for example P-1686 142.
Wright County Egg’s media statement indicates that there have been confirmed Salmonella enteritidis illnesses relating to shell eggs from Wright County Egg, and traceback investigations are ongoing.
Consumers who believe they may have purchased these shell eggs should not eat them but should return them to the store where they were purchased for a full refund. This recall is of shell eggs only. Consumers with questions should call 1-877-249-8224 or visit www.eggsafety.org.

 E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

                                  Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 The fully cooked, ready-to-eat, calzone products were produced on April 10, 2012, and then shipped to institutions in Indiana and Michigan. The following products are subject to recall: [View

Wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.
                                              
Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to

handwashing
                                              . If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses. Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook ground meat such as beef to an internal temperature of 160° F, as measured with a food thermometer, before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

                                  Salmonella Enteritidis, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 The products subject to recall, sold wholesale and for further processing:
                                  14 pound chub packages of ""Grnd Beef Fine 85/15"", packed 3 chubs to approximate 42-pound cases.
                                  
 The products subject to recall bears the establishment number ""EST. 9400"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. While the use-by date has passed and these products are no longer available for retail sale, FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen in consumers' freezers. These products were produced on May 25, 2012, and were shipped to distribution centers in Connecticut, Maine and New York for further distribution.

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away.
                                              
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for ground meat such as beef and pork is 160° F, and 165° F for poultry, as determined with a food thermometer.
                                              
Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.
                                            
                                          
                                                                               
                                                                            
                                    
It is important to note that the above listed products were repackaged into consumer-size packages and sold under different retail brand names. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on FSIS' website at:

 FSIS became aware of the problem during the course of an  
                                  ongoing investigation of a multi-state outbreak of  
                                  Salmonella Enteritidis involving 33 case-patients from 7 states (MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VA, VT-preliminary data, subject to change). Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Vermont Department of Health, New York State Department of Health, and New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets, FSIS was able to link illnesses in five case-patients to the ground beef products produced at this establishment based on epidemiologic and traceback investigations, as well as in-store reviews. Illness onset dates among these five case-patients ranged from June 6, 2012 to June 13, 2012. Two of the five case-patients were hospitalized. Leftover product with no packaging information collected during the course of this investigation by the Vermont Department of Health tested positive for  
                                  Salmonella Enteritidis with the outbreak strain. This outbreak strain of  
                                  Salmonella Enteritidis is drug sensitive, meaning antibiotics can be effective in treating patients who need them. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC and public health partners on the investigation.
                                  
 Consumption of food contaminated with  
                                  Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses.  
                                  Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV infection or those undergoing chemotherapy. The most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

2012,10,10,us,"2012 - Dean Foods Company of California and Meadow Gold Dairy Conduct Voluntary Recall of Two Albertsons Brand Ice Cream Varieties - Peanut Butter Cup and Peanut Butter Chocolate in 1.5 Quarts Sizes - Due to Potential Health Risk Posed by Nationwide Sunland, Inc. Peanut Butter","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – October 10, 2012 – The Dean Foods Company of California processing facility in Buena Park, Calif., and Meadow Gold Dairy processing facility in Orem, Utah, are taking the precautionary measure to voluntarily recall two ice cream varieties manufactured for Albertsons supermarkets. This recall was initiated because the affected products contain a peanut butter ingredient supplied by Sunland, Inc. which may be contaminated with Salmonella. The peanut butter manufacturer Sunland recently expanded its nationwide product recall.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
To date, no complaints or reactions have been reported related to these ice cream products, and only two flavors of Albertsons ice cream are included in the recall. No Meadow Gold® brand ice cream products are included in this recall. Both the “Peanut Butter Cup” and “Peanut Butter Chocolate” flavors are sold in 1.5 quarts (1.42L) cardboard cartons in Albertsons stores. Only the ice cream made in two plants is impacted by this recall and therefore the product being recalled was sold between 3/26/2010 and 9/25/2012 only in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Washington.
The ice cream is printed with one of two plant codes: either 49-11 or 06-20 and a “BEST BY” or “EXP” date ranging from 3/26/2011 to 9/25/2013.
No other Albertsons or Meadow Gold brand ice cream products are affected by this recall. In particular, this recall only impacts Albertsons ice cream products with the plant codes of 49-11 or 06-20 and sold in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Washington.
The processing facilities have ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product package to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the Company at 1-800-587-2259 between 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central Time, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been notified of this voluntary recall.

The products were produced between April 4, and Oct. 19, 2012, and will have the establishment number M-952 or M-6785 inkjetted on the side of the package. Product purchased fresh will have a use-by date between Oct. 14, 2012 and Dec. 4, 2012 listed.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - October 24, 2012 - Bumble Bar is recalling certain lots of Gluten Free Café™ Chocolate Sesame Bars and Gluten Free Café™ Cinnamon Sesame Bars associated with Sunland Inc. peanut products, because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infection in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.  Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  Consumers with the above symptoms should consult their physician.
While no illnesses associated with any of these products have been reported to date, as part our commitment to the safety and quality of our products we are issuing a voluntary recall, which includes expired product. 
The ‘Best Buy’ date is located on the lower left panel of the 12-pack retail box and is also located on the back film of each individual bar.  The specific product and lot codes are as follows:
Retail
The recalled products were distributed nationwide from June, 2011 to October, 2012, and exported primarily to retail stores, and through internet orders.   Consumers who have purchased any products covered by this recall should destroy them or return them to the retail store where purchased for a full refund.  Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-434-4246 during extended hours from today through Friday from 9 am to 9 pm EDT.  After hours and weekend calls will be monitored and returned promptly.

2013,2,11,us,2013 - Nestlé Prepared Foods Company Announces Voluntary Recall of LEAN CUISINE® Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - February 8, 2013 - Nestlé Prepared Foods Company today announced the voluntary recall of two production codes of LEAN CUISINE® Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli, UPC 13800-58358. The production codes are 2311587812 and 2312587812; the “best before date” appears as DEC 2013.
The voluntary recall is limited to these two days of production, which were distributed nationwide. No other production dates, sizes or varieties of LEAN CUISINE products are affected by this recall. The reason for the recall is that the meal may contain fragments of glass. Nestlé is taking this action after three consumers reported they had found small fragments of glass in the ravioli portion of the entrée. No injuries were reported by any of the consumers.
The entrée being recalled was produced during early November, 2012. Due to its popularity, Nestlé believes very little remains in retail distribution. For this reason, Nestlé is reaching out to consumers to ask that they examine their freezer inventory for specific packages of LEAN CUISINE®, Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli, UPC 13800-58358 with production codes 2311587812 and 2312587812 and a “best before date” which appears as DEC 2013. To locate the production code, consumers should look for the gray “proof of purchase” panel, located on the right end flap of the package, below the ingredient statement.
Consumers who may have purchased the recalled LEAN CUISINE item should not consume the product, but instead should contact Nestlé Consumer Services at (866) 586-9424 or leancuisine@casupport.com for further instructions. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., ET and this Saturday, February 9, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Nestlé will provide a replacement coupon to reporting consumers and also may make arrangements to retrieve the product for further examination.
Nestlé is dedicated to food quality, and the health and safety of its consumers. For these reasons, the company initiated this recall. We apologize to our retail customers and consumers and sincerely regret any inconvenience created by this voluntary product recall.

2013,7,13,us,2009 - torres hillsdale country cheese llc expands the recall of asadero and oaxaca cheeses due to possible listeria contamination,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- March 23, 2009 -- Torres Hillsdale Country Cheese of Reading, Michigan is expanding the recall of Asadero and Oaxaca soft Mexican-style cheeses due to potential Listeria contamination.   
Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause Listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. Listeriosis can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea. Listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths. The very young, the pregnant, the elderly and persons with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to infection. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.
Products were distributed to the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Alabama.

2013,7,16,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america provides additional information about expanded nationwide recall of peanut products,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (February 8, 2009) -- In connection with the January 28, 2009 expanded recall announcement issued by Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), the company wishes to highlight important information regarding several of its products.
On January 28, 2009, PCA announced it was voluntarily recalling all peanuts and peanut products processed in its Blakely, Georgia facility since January 1, 2007 because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurisms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
PCA has not manufactured any products in cans and jars since 2007. However, because the January 28th recall notice indicated that PCA does not sell products directly to consumers in stores, and because the expanded recall includes PCA products made since the beginning of 2007, the potential for confusion may exist. Therefore, the company is highlighting information about those former retail offerings to assist consumers who may have purchased those products and who may still have them in their possession. These products were part of the January 28th recall, but here, they are individually listed. Consumers should be aware that the list below includes only PCA's own brands that were sold to consumers at retail. The list does not include brands made by PCA for other firms. FDA continues to update its website to alert the public about any new recalls.
PCA sold its Casey’s, Parnell’s Pride, Reggie, and Robinson Crusoe labels to 99 Cent Stuff, 99 Cents Only Stores, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree Stores. Below is a list of items and UPC codes that were shipped to these discount retail chain stores and other customers that are affected by this recall:

2013,8,23,us,California Firm Recalls Cured Pork Products Due To Misbranding And Undeclared Allergen,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 23, 2013 – Westlake Foods, a Santa Ana, Calif., establishment, is recalling approximately 47,419 pounds of cured pork products because of misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products contain wheat, a known allergen which is not declared on the labels.

The products subject to recall include:

11-lb. to 13-lb. blocks of “Tay Ho Cured Pork Artificially Colored.” This product was distributed for institutional use nationwide.

14-oz. packages of “Tay Ho Cured Pork Sausage With Pork Ears And Snouts.” This product was distributed for retail sales nationwide.

11-lb. to 13-lb. blocks of “Don Café Cured Pork Meat and Binder Product Pork skin added.” This product was distributed for institutional use in the Houston, Texas area.
The products bear the establishment number “EST. 1627A” inside the USDA Mark of Inspection. They can be further identified by a case code “213001” through “213234.” All products were produced between Jan. 1, 2013, and Aug. 22, 2013.

The problem was discovered by an FSIS inspector during a routine label review. The problem is believed to have occurred due to a change in the company’s spice mix, which was not reflected on the products’ labels.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

2013,10,12,us,California Wholesale Store Recalls Rotisserie Chicken Products Due to Possible Salmonella Heidelberg Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12, 2013 – Costco’s El Camino Real store in South San Francisco, Calif., is recalling 9,043 units (approximately 39,755 lbs.) of rotisserie chicken products that may be contaminated with a strain of Salmonella Heidelberg, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The products subject to recall are:

8,730 “Kirkland Signature Foster Farms” rotisserie chickens

313 total units of “Kirkland Farm” rotisserie chicken soup, rotisserie chicken leg quarters, and rotisserie chicken salad
The products were sold directly to consumers in a Costco located at 1600 El Camino Real, South San Francisco, Calif., between Sept. 11 and Sep. 23, 2013.

This recall was initiated due to concerns about a group of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that may be associated with the consumption of rotisserie chicken products prepared in and purchased at the Costco El Camino Real store. The PFGE pattern (0258) associated with this outbreak is reported rarely in the United States. FSIS, working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health and the County of San Mateo Public Health Department, determined through epidemiologic and traceback investigations that there is a link between the Costco El Camino Real rotisserie chicken products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC, public health partners in California and Costco on the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available.

This group of illnesses is part of a larger cluster of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that are known to be multi-drug resistant. For more information about the larger cluster, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. Costco has already taken steps to contact every customer who purchased rotisserie chicken products. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/current-recalls-and-alerts.

Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact Costco at (800) 774-2678.

FSIS reminds consumers to properly handle raw poultry in a manner to prevent contamination from spreading to other foods and food contact surfaces.

FSIS further reminds consumers of the critical importance of following package cooking instructions for frozen or fresh chicken products and general food safety guidelines when handling and preparing any raw meat or poultry. In particular, while cooking instructions may give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each side of the product in order to attain 165 °F internal temperature, consumers should be aware that actual time may vary depending on the cooking method (broiling, frying, or grilling) and the temperature of the product (chilled versus frozen) so it is important that the final temperature of 165 °F must be reached for safety. Please do not rely on the cooking time for each side of the product, but use a food thermometer.

All poultry products should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165° F as determined by a food thermometer. Using a food thermometer is the only way to know that food has reached a high enough temperature to destroy foodborne bacteria.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV or undergoing chemotherapy. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within eight to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days.

Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov. The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day.

#


Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis:

Wash hands before and after handling raw meat and poultry with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.

Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing.

If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures (160º F for ground meat such as beef and pork and 165º F for all poultry, as measured with a food thermometer) before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90º F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.","On 2013-10-12, occurred in us.

FSIS, working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health and the County of San Mateo Public Health Department, determined through epidemiologic and traceback investigations that there is a link between the Costco El Camino Real rotisserie chicken products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC, public health partners in California and Costco on the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available.

This group of illnesses is part of a larger cluster of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that are known to be multi-drug resistant. For more information about the larger cluster, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. Costco has already taken steps to contact every customer who purchased rotisserie chicken products. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/current-recalls-and-alerts.

Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact Costco at (800) 774-2678.

FSIS reminds consumers to properly handle raw poultry in a manner to prevent contamination from spreading to other foods and food contact surfaces.

FSIS further reminds consumers of the critical importance of following package cooking instructions for frozen or fresh chicken products and general food safety guidelines when handling and preparing any raw meat or poultry. In particular, while cooking instructions may give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each side of the product in order to attain 165 °F internal temperature, consumers should be aware that actual time may vary depending on the cooking method (broiling, frying, or grilling) and the temperature of the product (chilled versus frozen) so it is important that the final temperature of 165 °F must be reached for safety. Please do not rely on the cooking time for each side of the product, but use a food thermometer.

All poultry products should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165° F as determined by a food thermometer. Using a food thermometer is the only way to know that food has reached a high enough temperature to destroy foodborne bacteria.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV or undergoing chemotherapy. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within eight to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days.

Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov. The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day.

Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis:

Wash hands before and after handling raw meat and poultry with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.

Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing.

If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures (160º F for ground meat such as beef and pork and 165º F for all poultry, as measured with a food thermometer) before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90º F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.",

2014,3,7,us,Arkansas Firm Recalls Chicken Products Due To Misbranding and Undeclared Allergen,"WASHINGTON, March 7, 2014 – George’s Inc., a Springdale, Ark. establishment, is recalling approximately 29,200 pounds of seasoned raw, chicken breast strips due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products are formulated with soy protein, a known allergen, and monosodium glutamate (MSG). However, the product was released with a label for George’s boneless skinless breast pieces with rib meat, which does not declare soy or MSG on the label.

The products subject to recall bear the label:

40 lb. bulk cartons of “GEORGE’S BONELESS SKINLESS BREAST PIECES W/RIB MEAT” with case code 4790.
The products were produced and packaged from Dec. 21 through Dec. 23, 2013, and were sold to distributors in Tennessee and Iowa for further distribution. The recalled products bear the establishment number “P-13584” below the USDA Mark of Inspection and “Packed on” date in the format of “mm/dd/yy” on the carton label.

The problem was discovered after the company received a customer complaint of incorrectly labeled product. The customer noticed that the product they received appeared to be seasoned, when it was labeled as being simply boneless, skinless breast pieces. The company’s investigation found that the mislabeling occurred when the George’s label was mistakenly applied to allergen containing products packaged nearby. FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

2014,5,29,us,Recall Notification Report 033-2014 (Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts),"WASHINGTON, May 29, 2014– Boulder Natural Meats, a Denver, Colo., establishment, is recalling approximately 363 pounds of Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts due to misbranding, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The product was formulated with wheat, which is declared on the product label, so all allergens are properly identified. However, the front label states the product is gluten free.

The problem was discovered by a retailer, which notified the company. After an investigation, it was determined that the front label was mislabeled “gluten free,” because an older label was mistakenly used.

2014,8,27,us,New Jersey Firm Recalls Breaded Chicken Product For Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, August 27, 2014 – TNUVA USA, a Fairfield, N.J., establishment is recalling approximately 8,316 pounds of Mom’s Chicken Extra Thin Cutlets product due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The product was produced on August 18, 2013, and shipped to the company’s distributor in New Jersey. FSIS will post complete store locations as the list becomes available on its website at www.fsis.usda.gov. The following product is subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

28.8-oz. (1.8 lb.) bags containing “MOM’S CHICKEN EXTRA THIN CUTLETS, THIN-CUT BREADED CUTLET SHAPED CHICKEN BREAST PATTIES.”
Bags bear the Israeli establishment number “209” within the Israeli mark of inspection. The product’s expiration date is February 18, 2015, and bears the following UPC number on the packaging: 843426005866.

The problem was discovered when FSIS personnel conducted a routine sampling of product which tested positive for Lm. FSIS held the product and it did not enter commerce. Further investigation by FSIS determined that other products were produced on the same line without clean up between products. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products

Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

2014,11,22,us,Minnesota Firm Recalls Ground Beef Products Due To Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 22, 2014 – Ranchers Legacy Meat Co., of Vadnais Heights, Minn., is recalling 1,200 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

Products subject to the recall are packaged in plastic cryovac sealed packets, and contain various weights of ground beef. All products produced on Nov. 19, 2014 are subject to recall.

All of the following have a Package Code (use by) 12/10/2014 and bear the establishment number “Est. 40264” inside the USDA mark of inspection. Individual products include:

Ranchers Legacy Ground Beef Patties 77/23
	Ranchers Legacy Ground Chuck Patties 80/20
	Ranchers Legacy USDA Choice Ground Beef 80/20

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 ° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should call Jeremy Turnquist, Vice President of Operations for Ranchers Legacy Meat Co. at (651) 366-6575.

2015,1,17,us,illinois firm recalls pork products produced without benefit of inspection,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 17, 2015 – Kalle USA, a Chicago, Ill., establishment, is recalling approximately 168,473 pounds of pork products that were not presented at the U.S. point of entry for inspection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. Without the benefit of full inspection, a possibility of adverse health consequences exists. 

The following items, produced between Oct. 18, 2013 and Nov. 19, 2014, are subject to recall:

2,976 - 44.10 lb. bags of “SCAN PORK DP-941 NATURAL DEHYDRATED PORK STOCK/NATIONAL DEHYDRATED PORK BROTH” and bearing packaging codes “JJ820738638, JJ820860580, JJ82082258, JJ820889803 or JJ820645387” on the labels.

2015,3,7,us,rio tex wholesale meats recalls ready-to-eat beef products due to possible listeria contamination,"WASHINGTON, March 6, 2015 – Rio Tex Wholesale Meats, a Mercedes, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 58,180 pounds of ready-to-eat beef products that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The beef products were produced on various dates between March 25, 2014 and February 19, 2015. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods COOKED BEEF TACO FILLING.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods SEASONED COOKED BEEF BARBACOA.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods FULLY COOKED BARBACOA.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods BEEF CARNE GUISADA.”

15-lb. and 45-lb. boxes containing three 5-lb. or 15-lb. packages of “Rio-Tex-Meats BARBACOA.”
The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 13545” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were shipped for hotels, restaurants and institutional use in Texas.

The problem was discovered when FSIS personnel reviewed historical sampling data in the context of recent intensified verification testing with multiple Listeria monocytogenes positives. The historical sampling showed a recurrence of Lm isolates with indistinguishable Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns over a period of time within the establishment. The presence of isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns in environmental samples (including food contact and non-food contact surfaces) and on ready-to-eat meat products indicates that there are insufficient sanitary measures to prevent contamination of the production environment and the products with Lm.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

 WASHINGTON, March 6, 2015 – Rio Tex Wholesale Meats, a Mercedes, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 58,180 pounds of ready-to-eat beef products that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The beef products were produced on various dates between March 25, 2014 and February 19, 2015. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods COOKED BEEF TACO FILLING.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods SEASONED COOKED BEEF BARBACOA.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods FULLY COOKED BARBACOA.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods BEEF CARNE GUISADA.”

15-lb. and 45-lb. boxes containing three 5-lb. or 15-lb. packages of “Rio-Tex-Meats BARBACOA.”
The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 13545” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were shipped for hotels, restaurants and institutional use in Texas.

The problem was discovered when FSIS personnel reviewed historical sampling data in the context of recent intensified verification testing with multiple Listeria monocytogenes positives. The historical sampling showed a recurrence of Lm isolates with indistinguishable Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns over a period of time within the establishment. The presence of isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns in environmental samples (including food contact and non-food contact surfaces) and on ready-to-eat meat products indicates that there are insufficient sanitary measures to prevent contamination of the production environment and the products with Lm.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

2015,8,13,us,Kapowsin Meats Recalls Pork Product Due To Possible Salmonella Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 13, 2015 – Kapowsin Meats, a Graham, Wash. establishment, is recalling approximately 116,262 pounds of whole hogs that may be contaminated with Salmonella I4,[5],12:i:-,the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The whole hogs for barbeque item were produced on various dates between April 18, 2015 and July 27, 2015. The following products are subject to recall:

Varying weights of Whole Hogs for Barbeque
The product subject to recall bears the establishment number “Est. 1628” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was shipped to various individuals, retail locations, institutions, and distributors in Alaska and Washington.

On July 15, 2015, the Washington State Department of Health notified FSIS of an investigation of Salmonella I4,[5],12:i:-illnesses. Working in conjunction with the Washington State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FSIS determined that there is a link between whole hogs for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats and these illnesses. Traceback investigation has identified 32 case-patients who consumed whole hogs for barbeque from this establishment prior to illness onset. These illnesses are part of a larger illness investigation. Based on epidemiological evidence, 134 case-patients have been identified in Washington with illness onset dates ranging from April 25, 2015 to July 29, 2015. FSIS continues to work with our public health partners on this ongoing investigation.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume pork and whole hogs for barbeque that have been cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145° F with a three minute rest time. The only way to confirm that whole hogs for barbeque are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ. For whole hogs for barbeque make sure to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer in several places. Check the temperature frequently and replenish wood or coals to make sure the fire stays hot. Remove only enough meat from the carcass as you can serve within 1-2 hours.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact John Anderson, Owner, at (253) 847-1777.

2016,2,17,us,lipari foods issues voluntary recall of various retail and food service raw pistachio products due to potential salmonella risk,"Lipari Foods, LLC, of Warren, Michigan, has issued a voluntary recall of various raw pistachio products packaged by sister company JLM due to potential Salmonella risk. Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella can experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The products were distributed to food service and retail stores throughout Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin and West Virginia.
Products were distributed under the following brand names: Blue Goose Market, Hollywood Market, Market Fresh Fine Foods, Roger's Foodland, Marv & Alison's Marketplace, Long Lake Market, Martin's, Holiday Market, The Purple Onion, Trentwood Farms, Angeli Foods, Market Square, Village Food Market, Martha's Vineyard, Remke Market or as generic product without branding.
The affected products can be identified by:
There are no reported illnesses in connection with these products to date.
This was brought to our attention by our supplier, International Foodsource, LLC who recalled raw pistachios after testing performed by an FDA contract testing laboratory revealed the presence of Salmonella. As a precaution, Lipari Foods products are being recalled as they have the potential to be contaminated due to the fact that they were packed from an affected lot that was received from International Foodsource, LLC. We are working closely with International Foodsource, LLC and the FDA to understand the cause of the situation and ensure that all affected product has been pulled from commerce.
Consumers who have purchased this recalled product should not consume it. They should return it to the point of purchase.
